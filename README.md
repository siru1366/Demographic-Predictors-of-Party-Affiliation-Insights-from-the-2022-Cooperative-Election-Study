# Demographic Predictors of Party Affiliation: Insights from the 2022 Cooperative Election Study
## Overview
Our study investigates the political leanings of American voters, particularly their affiliation with the Democratic and Republican parties, and its relationship with demographic factors. Analyzing data from the 2022 Cooperative Election Study, we utilized logistic regression analysis to identify key predictors of party allegiance. Specifically, our findings indicate that gender, race, and education level strongly influence political leanings, with women, black people, Latinos, and individuals with higher education levels exhibiting a greater tendency to align with the Democratic Party.
